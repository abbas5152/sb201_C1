Question 2:


● Explain difference between JPA and Hibernate:

->Here Hibernate is an ORM software.There are so many companies making ORM softwares.

->Every company using their own API to create there ORM software.

->so if any user want to switch from one software to another software they can't
because API is different for all this software.

->To overcome this problem oracle corporation devloped JPA api.

->so every ORM software have compoulsorly use JPA api in their software and they can also use 
their own api too.

->So basically JPA is specification and Hibernate is one of the famous implementation.

->JPA api belongs to "javax.persistence" package and hibernate api belongs to
 "org.hibernate " package.


● Explain about the Layered Architecture of a Java Based Business application:

In any Business Application there is three layers 

1) Data Access layer
2) Business Logic layer
3) Presentation layer


1)Data Access layer:

->In this layer we have to create java classes and interfaces to perform CRUD operation.

->CRUD means create delete update opeartions.

->we have to performs this CRUD operation using this methods.

->In JDBC and DAO pattern are example of this layer.In this we have to pass sql
query to perform CRUD operation.

->ORM software is also example of this using ORM software example Hibernate
we can perfome CRUD operation with database.


2)Business Logic layer:

-> In this layer we have to implement Business services in Programming Logic.

->For this we have to write java classes and interfaces.By using this methods
we can perform business logic.

->In which this business logic is perfroms it's called Business logic layer.

->for Example In jiomart website if we want to add any product in our cart we have to click 
cart button.so that product added in cart.This is a part of business logic

3) Presentation Layer:

->This is layer is related with end user.

->For example in JIOMART if we search in search box "rice" the photos and prices 
will display on screen.

->That part of the application is called presentation layer.

->Using Frontend technlogy like React we can make it more intercating with user.


3)Presentation Layer:
As in the name mentioned Presentation it means there is some classes in java that shows the 
input screen and also output screen.It is interacting with the end user.
